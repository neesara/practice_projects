1) Use case : You want to practice sql, but find it difficult to install mysql in your laptop, then how will you run it in docker :
In windows after installing docker use powershell for docker commands :
docker run --name=mysql1 -d mysql/enterprise-server:8.0 ==> This will pull sql image and start running it locally, -d means detached mode (run in background)
docker logs mysql1    ====> Find password like this in this output "GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: XXXXXXXXXX"
docker exec -it mysql1 mysql -uroot -p   => Here use the above weird password and login, you will get sql console
In SQL console type :  ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'abc123'  => Here abc123 is the new password
Now you can use mysql to enter your commands.
After done for now enter : docker stop mysql1      => this will stop container but state will be preserved
You can again login as : docker exec -it mysql1 mysql -uroot -p  ,and enter the password
