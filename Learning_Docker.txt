******************************************************************
Learning SQL;
SELECT * FROM table;
SELECT name, value1 FROM table;

SELECT DISTINCT language FROM films;      => select all the unique values from a column, this might be useful if, for example, you're interested in knowing which languages are represented in the films table, DISTINCT qualifier refers to a unique row of data, not a unique column.

To count :
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate)
FROM people;
FROM films;

To get the column names written the way we want, we would write the query thus:
SELECT animal_type AS Animal,
       sex_upon_intake AS Sex,
       age_upon_intake AS Age,
       intake_condition AS Condition
  FROM austin_animal_center_intakes

you have to surround the replacement text with backticks. The backtick (`) is the keyboard character on the same key as the tilda (~)–not to be confused with the single quote character.
eg : 
SELECT animal_type AS `animal type`,
       sex_upon_intake AS `sex upon intake`,
       age_upon_intake AS `age upon intake`,
       intake_condition AS `intake condition`
  FROM austin_animal_center_intakes
